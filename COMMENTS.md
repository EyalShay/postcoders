# put your "I would have done this with more time"-style comments here

I was unable to complete task 5 within the 2 hour time limit. I think that it should definitely be possible to use a cache that saves the data from queries that have already been requested and then being able to present the stored data upon a repeated request, thus avoiding a scenario where the api is being sent multiple requests for the same information. Given more time, for this particular task I would try to store the data locally somehow in an array of objects. I would use the outcode as the key for each area object and then check if that key exists with an if statement, and if it does, present that data to the user rather than send a repeated request to the api. I will certainly be trying to figure it out for my own knowledge after finishing this tech test :)
